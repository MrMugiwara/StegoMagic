# StegoMagic

Stegnography tools implement intelligent algorithms to carefully embed the encrypted text messages or data inside other larger files such as an image, audio, video or an executable file. Some tools will embed the encrypted data at the end of another file so that there will be enough room for storing larger data.

There are many steganography tools available online but only a few are able to work flawlessly. I did not find any tool that worked perfectly on both small and large data. However, I have  managed to develop my own tool that can work perfectly on all types of files and all size of data.


1. All the files used in the process must be present in the local directory (folder) from which the StegoMagic tool is executed. 

2. You need to type the filenames along with the extension. Otherwise you will receive an error message.

For example,

abc.jpg, nature.jpg, file.exe, cartoon.gif, video.avi etc. 


3. Use StegoMagic_TXT.exe to hide a text message inside any other file of your choice such as an image, video, sound or an EXE file.

4. Use StegoMagic_BIN.exe to hide one binary file in another.

For example,

You can hide a .jpg image in a .exe file or vice versa.  

You can use this tool (StegoMagic_BIN.exe) to hide any file of your choice in any other file. There are no limitations on what type of file can be hidden in one another. There are no limitations on the size of the file as well. So it is possible to hide 1 GB video file in a 500 KB image file.

5. Keep the "secret decryption key" safe which is required during the decryption process. The key will be displayed and a text file containing your secret decryption key will also be generated at the end of the encryption process.

6. If you enter a wrong key during the decryption process, the output file generated will be of no use.

NOTE: If you are using Windows 7 or 8 or 10, you need to run this tool as an administrator.
